# Lab: Git Providers, Integrations, and Clients
In this chapter, we will cover the following recipes:

Setting up an organization at GitHub
Creating a repository at GitHub
Adding templates for issues and pull requests

#### Introduction
It is possible to host your own Git installation and maintain a central server for your organization. If you are a small company or an open source project, maintaining such an infrastructure can be a burden. But today, there exists a number of Git providers who can lift the burden.

GitHub is the best-known Git provider with 40 million users. Many high-profiled open source projects are hosted by GitHub. Once you have created an account at GitHub, you can explore the 85 million Git repositories currently hosted.

#### Pre-reqs:
- Google Chrome (Recommended)

#### Lab Environment
There is no requirement for any setup.

There should be terminal opened already. You can also open New terminal by Clicking `File` > `New` > `Terminal` from the top menu.

Run the following command in **terminal**:
`cd ~/work/git/12/ && mv git .git`

**Note:** To copy and paste: use **Control-C** and to paste inside of a terminal, use **Control-V**
