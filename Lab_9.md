# Lab: Extracting Data from the Repository
In this chapter, we will cover the following recipes:

Extracting the top contributor
Finding bottlenecks in the source tree
Grepping the commit messages
The contents of the releases
Finding what has been achieved in the repository in the last period

#### Introduction
Whether you work in big or small organizations, safeguarding and maintaining data is always important and it keeps track of a fair amount of information for you; it is just a matter of extracting the data. Some of the data is included in the system by you or any other developer when the commit message is filled in with the proper information â€“ for instance, details of the bug you are fixing from the bug tracking system.

The data is not only valid for management but can also be used to add more time to refactor the C files, where almost all bugs are fixed.

#### Pre-reqs:
- Google Chrome (Recommended)

#### Lab Environment
There is no requirement for any setup.

There should be terminal opened already. You can also open New terminal by Clicking `File` > `New` > `Terminal` from the top menu.

Run the following command in **terminal**:
`cd ~/work/git/12/ && mv git .git`

**Note:** To copy and paste: use **Control-C** and to paste inside of a terminal, use **Control-V**
