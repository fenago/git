# Lab: Branching, Merging, and Options
In this chapter, we will cover the following recipes:

Managing your local branches
Branches with remotes
Forcing a merge commit
Using git reuse recorded resolution (rerere) to merge Git conflicts
Computing the difference between branches
Orphan branches

#### Introduction
If you are developing a small application in a big corporation as a developer, or you are trying to wrap your head around an open source project from GitHub, you have already been using branches with Git.

Most of the time, you may have just been working on a local development or master branch, and so didn't care so much about other branches.

In this chapter, we will show you different branch types and how to work with them.

#### Pre-reqs:
- Google Chrome (Recommended)

#### Lab Environment
There is no requirement for any setup.

There should be terminal opened already. You can also open New terminal by Clicking `File` > `New` > `Terminal` from the top menu.

Run the following command in **terminal**:
`cd ~/work/git/12/ && mv git .git`

**Note:** To copy and paste: use **Control-C** and to paste inside of a terminal, use **Control-V**
